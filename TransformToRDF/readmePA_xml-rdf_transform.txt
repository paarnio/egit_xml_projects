 * main method: XML file transformed to RDF file by using XMLToRDFParser.java
 * Generic XML to RDF transformer in Java
 * Below is the source code for a generic XML to RDF transformer, written in the
 * Java programming language. It takes any XML file as input and provides an RDF
 * model as output. It does not make any assumptions of the source format, so it is
 * guaranteed to work on any kind of XML, though the quality of the output depends
 * on how well the source data translates into triple-based data.
